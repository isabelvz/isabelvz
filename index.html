Hi, I’m Isabel. I'm a copywriter and the mother of two little pricks plus a chunky middle-aged girl corgi (guess who’s my favourite?). Here’s a clue: she's related to Queen Elizabeth II.  
I heard Judy Blume once say in of those intro videos for Masterclass: “Why would you write if you didn’t have to? It’s so hard.” And that’s when I realised: I feel I have to, or else I think I would just sort of disappear into thin air? It turns out my writing is good enough for people to pay me, so that worked out well. 
I love writing meaningful stories, be it for brand campaigns or editorial projects, so if you’re looking for someone short in height yet big on opinions to give your brand a human voice and help you connect with your audience, I’m your gal. 
Born and based in Lisbon!

<strong>Ace & Tate</strong>

Take Another Look

Create new company tagline for Ace & Tate to help establish a consistent brand identity

Campaign copy + film script + editorial campaign + press release 

I was given the task of creating a new tagline for Ace & Tate, more in tune with its company values. The campaign included video and photography created in collaboration with agency HALAL, and was promoted through the website, Youtube, social media channels, editorial content and in a selection of Ace & Tate stores.

Oh Crap, it’s Christmas.

Sell more gift cards

Concept and copy 

Instead of focusing on the wonders of Christmas, we got very real and created a campaign that talked about the stressful side of Christmas, particularly gift giving. The main message being that the Ace & Tate gift card is the ideal gift, because it shows loved ones you care, and requires no big effort at all. The project was adapted to retail as well, and we created a 'Gift hotline' with our CX team tht allowed customers to call in and get gifting advice.

The most thoughtful, thoughtless gift out there.

Christmas editorial project "Super Gezellige"

To engage and connect with our audience through compelling, creative content.

For Christmas 2019, we created an editorial project for the Ace & Tate journal that involved sharing personal, non-conventional stories on conventional recipes. We invited creatives such as artistic food practice <a href="https://longprawn.com/" target="_blank">Long Prawn</a> to contribute, as well as Amsterdam’s wine connoisseurs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/salonvinnaturel/?hl=en" target="_blank">Salon Vin Naturel</a> to prepare the wine pairing for each meal.

I wrote a piece about my mother’s chocolate mousse.

International Women's Day 2020 

Raise awareness around International Women's Day and connect with our audience for a good cause

Concept + talent research + project management + copy + editorial 

To celebrate International Women's Day, we invited male and female artists to create an original print inspired by Equality. Talent included London-based Kelly Anna and Venezuelan artist Carlín Díaz. 

The posters went for sale at our stores, and the proceeds went to the Fred Hollows Foundation US: a charity focused on helping visually-challenged girls and women, who have trouble getting access to proper healthcare due to gender-related issues.

<strong>Editorial</strong>

We need to talk about Failure

Write content to build brand identity and connect with audience 

Story + copy

The theme Failure has obviously been discussed a lot, especially since the rise of start-ups. I shared a different perspective on it, with the aim of connecting with the brand's audience and further establishing the brand's open-minded character.

<strong>Personal Work</strong>

Wieden+Kennedy: The Intersection exhibition 

I was invited by creative agency <a href=https://www.wk.com//">Wieden+Kennedy</a> to participate in a group exhibition that brought together female artists living in the Netherlands, to celebrate International Women’s Day.  It was hosted in collaboration with <a href="https://thetittymag.com/">The TittyMag</a>, and all proceeds went to non-profit organisation, <a https://www.neighborhoodfeminists.com/">Neighborhood Feminists</a>. The brief was to create a piece inspired by a woman I admire, and I chose to write about my Mum and her Unhappiness. I find there’s something quite beautiful about sadness. I wanted to express my admiration for my Mother, not because I think she is the perfect mother, but because I’m in awe of her imperfections, her rawness, her realness.
