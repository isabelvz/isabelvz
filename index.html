Hi, my name is Isabel van Zeller.

I love writing meaningful stories, be it for brand campaigns or editorial projects. 
Having said that, there are only two situations in which I’m lost for words: when describing myself to other people, and when speaking to Siri. Hence the former, I’ll let my work do the talking for me.

<strong>Projects — Ace & Tate</strong>

Take Another Look

Create new company tagline for Ace & Tate to help establish a consistent brand identity

Campaign copy + film script + Editorial campaign + Press release 

I was given the task of creating a new tagline for Ace & Tate, more in tune with its company values. The campaign included video and photography created in collaboration with agency HALAL, and was promoted through the website, Youtube, social media channels, editorial content and in a selection of Ace & Tate stores.

Oh Crap, it’s Christmas.

Sell more gift cards

Concept and copy 

Instead of focusing on the wonders of Christmas, we got very real and created a campaign that talked about the stressful side of Christmas, particularly gift giving. The main message being that the Ace & Tate gift card is the ideal gift, because it shows loved ones you care, and requires no big effort at all. The project was adapted to retail as well, and we created a 'Gift hotline' with our CX team tht allowed customers to call in and get gifting advice.

The most thoughtful, thoughtless gift out there.

International Women's Day 2020 

Raise awareness around International Women's Day and connect with our audience for a good cause

Concept + talent research + project management + copy + editorial 

To celebrate International Women's Day, we invited male and female artists to create an original print inspired by Equality <a href="https://www.aceandtate.com/us/journal/originals/IWD-eye-to-eye">Equality</a>. Talent included London-based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kellyannalondon/?hl=en">Kelly Anna</a> and Venezuelan artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carlindiaz/?hl=en">Carlín Díaz</a>. 

The posters went for sale at our stores, and the proceeds went to the Fred Hollows Foundation US: a charity focused on helping visually-challenged girls and women, who have trouble getting access to proper healthcare due to gender-related issues.

The Lernert and the Sander

Collaborate with popular dutch designers to raise brand awareness and reach the right audience

Copy

My idea was to create copy that matched the frame's kooky, comical persona. The landing page won an FWA award.

<strong>Editorial</strong>

We need to talk about Failure

Write content to build brand identity and connect with audience 

Story and copy

The theme Failure has obviously been discussed a lot, especially since the rise of start-ups. I shared a different perspective on it, with the aim of connecting with the brand's audience and further establishing the brand's open-minded character.

<strong>Personal Work</strong>

Wieden+Kennedy: The Intersection exhibition 

I was invited by creative agency <a href=https://www.wk.com//">Wieden+Kennedy</a> to participate in a group exhibition that brought together female artists living in the Netherlands, to celebrate International Women’s Day.  It was hosted in collaboration with <a href="https://thetittymag.com/">The TittyMag</a>, and all proceeds went to non-profit organisation, <a https://www.neighborhoodfeminists.com/">Neighborhood Feminists</a>. The brief was to create a piece inspired by a woman I admire, and I chose to write about my Mum and her Unhappiness. I find there’s something quite beautiful about sadness. I wanted to express my admiration for my Mother, not because I think she is the perfect mother, but because I’m in awe of her imperfections, her rawness, her realness.
