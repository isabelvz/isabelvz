I love writing and telling meaningful stories, be it for a brand campaign or editorial projects. 
Having said that, there are only two situations in which I’m lost for words: when describing myself to other people, and when speaking to Siri. Hence the former, I’ll let my work do the talking for me.

Take Another Look

Create new company tagline for Ace & Tate to help establish a consistent brand identity

Campaign copy + film script + Editorial campaign + Press release 

I was given the task of creating a new tagline for Ace & Tate, more in tune with its company values. The campaign included video and photography, and was promoted through the website, Youtube, social media channels, editorial content and in a selection of Ace & Tate stores.

Oh Crap, it’s Christmas.

Sell more gift cards

Concepting and copy 

Instead of focusing on the wonders of Christmas, we got very real and created a campaign that talked about the stressful side of Christmas, particularly gift giving. The main message being that the Ace & Tate gift card is the ideal gift, because it shows loved ones you care, and requires no big effort at all. The project was adapted to retail as well.

The most thoughtful, thoughtless gift out there.

The Lernert and the Sander

Collaborate with popular dutch designers to raise brand awareness and reach the right audience

Copy

My idea was to create copy that matched the frame's kooky, comical persona. The landing page won an FWA award.

<strong>Editorial</strong>

We need to talk about Failure

Write content to build brand identity and connect with audience 

Story and copy

The theme Failure has obviously been discussed a lot, especially since the rise of start-ups. I shared a different perspective on it, with the aim of connecting with the brand's audience and further establishing the brand's open-minded character.

A-Z Guide to Optimism

Campaign copy + editorial content + press release 

Ace & Tate chose to focus on Optimism during the first months of 2019. To kick things off, we compiled an A-Z guide to Optimism, which included some of the brand's favourite creative projects of the moment.
